```javascript
// Corrected Tailwind CSS configuration file.
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ 
    './src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}', // Include all relevant file types
    './index.html' // Add the index.html path if needed
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Make sure your `tailwind.config.js` file is correctly placed (usually in the root directory of your project) and that the paths specified within the `content` array accurately reflect the location of your HTML and JavaScript files that use Tailwind CSS classes.

For complex projects you may need to use glob patterns within the `content` array to handle multiple directories and file types effectively.

Ensure that you have run the `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer` command (or equivalent yarn command) to install the necessary packages.

After making changes to your `tailwind.config.js`, it is important to run the `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch` command (or the equivalent for your build process) to generate the stylesheet that includes your customized Tailwind CSS classes. This step will re-process your configuration and rebuild the CSS file to reflect changes.
