```javascript
// This is a Tailwind CSS configuration file.
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```
In this example, the `content` option is missing or incorrectly configured. This is a common mistake that often leads to Tailwind CSS not picking up your styles, even if your classes seem correct.

Another example:
```html
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
  This should be red!
</div>
```
If the above doesn't render as a red background, even with the Tailwind CSS config present and properly installed, there may be a problem with the way you've imported it, or whether your build process properly includes it.
