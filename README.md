# Tailwind CSS Configuration and Directive Errors

This repository demonstrates common configuration and directive errors encountered when using Tailwind CSS. It provides examples of incorrect configurations and their solutions.  The `bug.js` file shows examples of the error, while `bugSolution.js` offers fixes.

## Common Errors:

* **Incorrect `content` option in `tailwind.config.js`:** The `content` array must accurately point to your project's files containing Tailwind directives.  This is crucial for Tailwind to detect and process your classes.
* **Missing or incorrect Tailwind directives:** Ensure your HTML elements correctly utilize Tailwind CSS classes.  Typos or incorrect class names will prevent styles from being applied.
* **Build Process Issues:** Sometimes build process errors (e.g., Webpack, Vite, etc.) can interfere with the way Tailwind CSS classes are processed. Ensure your build pipeline correctly integrates Tailwind.
